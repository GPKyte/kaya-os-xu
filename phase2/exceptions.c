 * Exceptions.c

 * Covers three types of exceptions:

 *    2) System Calls & Breakpoints
 *    3) Table Management

 * Based on context from old-state vectors, decides course of action
 * loads the corresponding and appropriate new context.
 *
 * Uses oldState globally for simplicity and speed of reference
 * parameters and return values are handled at psuedo-register level
 * by accessing and mutating stored context.
